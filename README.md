FDM-Template
============

Template to manage file based working processes on small science workgroups

This online Repository is used to set up the basis Infrastructe f√ºr a Workgroup. I tried to fit the needs of
science workgroups basically at Basisresearch in Medicine. With this experiment, this infrastructe will be pulled to a
synchronized folder (we use PowerFolder). In addition every workgroup has its own shared folder, which will be visible
as "05 shared". the other folders are just visible to the owner.

If you have any suggestions to improve the folder structre, please feel free to tell me ;-)

Folder:

01 private
02 workbench
  01 protocolls
03 literature
04 SOP's
